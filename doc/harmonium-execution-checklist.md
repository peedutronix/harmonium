- [x] Keyboard shortcuts work
- [x] Click / touch playback works
- [x] Volume, octave, transpose controls work
- [x] Western / Sargam label switching works
- [x] Branding replaced with `Play Harmonium`
- [x] Two initial SEO posts added
- [x] Privacy policy and terms replaced
- [x] RBAC initialized
- [x] Default config data initialized
